### Hi thereðŸ‘‹!

I am currently working as a Development Engineer at an Airbus company InFactory Solutions GmbH, in Munich, Germany. Besides my paid jobs, I am also doing programming in my free time,
which you can find the repositories on my Github.

I always aim to have a potential business case for my private projects; therefore, most of my public repositories are originated from my online course activities. Nevertheless, you can see my contribution frequencies on all projects right at the bottom of this page.

In a chronological order, the followings are my project history:

### Build Automation for Gearbox Software

This is my very first professional project in the software development. I developed a standalone application which
enables gearbox developers to do compilation and simulation tests using different software configurations before
committing their changes into the server. This application eliminated the queue time for tests almost completely
and increased the software development productivity by about 90%.

I used .NET C# Windows Forms to develop the user interface and IronPython to integrate already existing python scripts
used to parse the simulation results. In this project I used PTC Integrity (MKS at that time) and IBM DOORS for requirement
management.
