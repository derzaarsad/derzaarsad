### Hi thereðŸ‘‹!

The fact that you landed on this page means that you want to know me more a bit deeper or unintentionally clicked the false link ðŸ˜„ Either way, I am so honored, and thank you for that!

I am currently working as a Development Engineer at an Airbus company InFactory Solutions GmbH, in Munich, Germany. Besides my paid jobs, I am also doing programming in my free time,
which you can find the repositories on my Github.

I always aim to have a potential business case for my private projects; therefore, most of my public repositories are originated from my online course activities. Nevertheless, you can see my contribution frequencies on all projects right at the bottom of this page.

In a chronological order, the followings are my project history:

# Build Automation for Parallel Shift Gearbox Software

# Plane Segmentation for a 3D Reconstruction System (KinKon)
