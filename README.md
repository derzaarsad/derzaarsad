### Hi thereðŸ‘‹!

The fact that you landed on this page means that you want to know me more a bit deeper or unintentionally clicked the false link ðŸ˜„ Either way, I am so honored, and thank you for that!

I am currently working as a Development Engineer at an Airbus company InFactory Solutions GmbH, in Munich, Germany. Besides my paid jobs, I am also doing programming in my free time,
which you can find the repositories on my Github.

I always aim to have a potential business case for my private projects; therefore, most of my public repositories are originated from my online course activities. Nevertheless, you can see my contribution frequencies on all projects right at the bottom of this page.

In a chronological order, the followings are my project history:

### Build Automation for Parallel Shift Gearbox (PSG) Software

This is my very first professional software development project. The task was to develop an application with GUI that can be used
by PSG-SW developers to test and build their software changes locally before checking it in the build server. After finishing this task,
I was tasked to build a regression test system for the existing build server.

I used .NET C# and Windows Forms to develop the GUI application and python scripts to parse the build results and for regression testing.
The python script is integrated into the GUI application using IronPython.

In this project I used PTC Integrity (I stood exactly on the transisition of MKS to PTC) and IBM DOORS for requirement management.
